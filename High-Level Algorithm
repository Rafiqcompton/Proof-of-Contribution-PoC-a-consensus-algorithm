Each node in the network measures and reports its contributions (e.g., storage, bandwidth, or computational resources) to a central registry or through a decentralized mechanism.
The network calculates a contribution score for each node based on the reported contributions and other factors, such as uptime and historical performance.
When a new block needs to be created, the network selects a node to be the block creator based on its contribution score. Nodes with higher scores have a higher probability of being chosen.
The selected node validates the transactions, creates the new block, and broadcasts it to the network.
Other nodes verify the new block and update their local copies of the blockchain.
The block creator receives a reward proportional to its contribution score, incentivizing further participation and resource sharing.
