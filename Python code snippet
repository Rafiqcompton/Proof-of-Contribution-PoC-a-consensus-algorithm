Here's a Python code snippet that demonstrates a simple implementation of the Proof of Contribution (PoC) algorithm. 
This example assumes that nodes have already reported their contributions, and the contribution scores have been calculated







import random

class Node:
    def __init__(self, node_id, contribution_score):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.contribution_score = contribution_score

def select_block_creator(nodes):
    total_score = sum(node.contribution_score for node in nodes)
    random_point = random.uniform(0, total_score)
    current_sum = 0

    for node in nodes:
        current_sum += node.contribution_score
        if current_sum >= random_point:
            return node

# Example usage
nodes = [
    Node("node1", 100),
    Node("node2", 200),
    Node("node3", 300),
    Node("node4", 400)
]

selected_node = select_block_creator(nodes)
print(f"Selected node: {selected_node.node_id}")
