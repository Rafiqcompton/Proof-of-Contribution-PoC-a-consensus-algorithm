Define the metrics for measuring contributions: Determine which resources (e.g., storage, bandwidth, or computational power) will be considered as contributions and how they will be measured and reported by the nodes.
Develop a scoring system: Create a scoring system that calculates a contribution score for each node based on its reported contributions and other factors, such as uptime and historical performance.
Implement the PoC consensus algorithm: Modify the existing blockchain code to incorporate the PoC consensus algorithm, including the selection of block creators based on their contribution scores.
Design a reward system: Develop a reward system that distributes rewards to block creators proportional to their contribution scores, incentivizing further participation and resource sharing.
Test the PoC blockchain: Thoroughly test the PoC-based blockchain to ensure its security, scalability, and efficiency. Perform simulations and stress tests to identify potential issues and optimize the system.
Deploy the PoC blockchain: Once the PoC blockchain has been tested and optimized, deploy it to a network of nodes and monitor its performance.
